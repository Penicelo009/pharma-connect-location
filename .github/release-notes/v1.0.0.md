**Title:** v1.0.0 — Production release (2026-02-02)

**Short summary**
A production-ready release of the Pharmacy marketplace MVP: secure auth, order & prescription workflows, offline-friendly uploads with dedup by checksum, embeddable React widgets for progressive migration, and full test coverage including Playwright E2E.

---

### Highlights ✨
- **Auth:** JWT access + refresh with refresh rotation and role-based access control.
- **Orders:** transactional creation, single-pharmacy enforcement, subscription checks, lifecycle states (pending → approved/rejected → completed).
- **Prescriptions:** secure file upload, checksum deduplication, review workflow, offline pending queue & sync.
- **Frontend:** Embeddable widgets (PrescriptionUpload, CartDrawer, PharmacyCard, CheckoutPage); non-breaking migration pattern; `StorageAdapter` with backend mirror + client fallback.
- **Tests & CI:** Unit + integration tests, Playwright E2E (pharmacy → checkout), GitHub Actions runs backend, frontend, and E2E jobs.
- **API contract:** All responses include `X-API-Version: 1` (enforced by CI).

### Upgrade / Deployment notes 🔧
- Backup your DB before applying migrations.
- Run migrations in the backend before switching traffic:
  - `cd backend`
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run migrate`
- Validate health endpoint:
  - `curl -i http://<host>:8080/api/_health | grep -i '^x-api-version: *1'`
- Frontend build & preview (for static preview in CI):
  - `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && npm run preview -- --port 5173`

> Important: storage driver remains the local driver by default. If switching to S3/Azure, configure credentials and test on staging before rollout.

---

### How to validate after release ✅
1. Health endpoint returns `X-API-Version: 1`.
2. Run the Playwright E2E (`frontend`): `npm run test:e2e` against preview build or staging.
3. Upload a prescription (UI) and verify dedup/lookup by checksum and that server-side record exists.
4. Create an order using the UI, confirm single-pharmacy check and order status lifecycle.
5. Monitor key metrics: error rate (4xx/5xx), P95 latency, prescription upload success rate.

---

### Rollback plan ⛔
- Revert to the previous deployment image immediately if critical regressions occur.
- If a destructive migration causes issues, restore DB from pre-release snapshot.
- Re-run smoke tests and E2E before re-opening traffic.
